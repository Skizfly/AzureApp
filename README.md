<h1>Deploy Web Application to Azure Web App (Azure)</h1>
Welcome to my tutorial on deploying a web app to Azure. I will illustrate the process of getting your application up and running on the Azure platform using Visual Studio.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure 
- Visual Studio
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Advanced Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Create Web App in Azure
- Create Web app framework 
- Connect deployment source 
- Deploy created app to Azure
- Test web app url in Azure

<h2>Azure Configuration Steps</h2>

Before embarking on the setup, it's prudent to initiate a resource group for meticulous organization. Once that's established, proceed to the quest for "app services" in your Azure environment.

Upon reaching the "App Services" section, click on the "Create" button, then select "Web App" from the dropdown menu (take note of other options and choose accordingly for your project). Assign a distinctive name to your app and configure the settings as per your requirements. Once done, proceed by clicking on "Review" and then "Create." Now, patiently wait for the deployment to complete and watch for the confirmation message.

Upon successful deployment, access the resource and observe the generated URL for your Azure web app. Execute a click on the link, initiating a new window. At this juncture, Azure eagerly awaits the coding input from your developed web application. Now, let's seamlessly transition to the subsequent phase of linking the two entities.

If you haven't done this yet, make sure to download Visual Studio from Microsoft; it's a free program. This is the tool we'll use to develop and deploy our web app to Azure. Additionally, before we kick off, it's crucial to create a new folder on your desktop or any easily accessible location â€“ this will serve as the container for your web app files.

With Visual Studio now active, begin by initiating a new project. Opt for the ASP.NET Core web app template in the next step. Proceed to configure your project details, ensuring you save it in the previously created folder. In the final steps, adjust any additional settings and then press the "Create" button.

<h2>A crucial point to consider</h2>
Upon relogging into the domain controller VM via Remote Desktop Connection, ensure logging in within the context of the domain. Input the domain path followed by the username, like mydomain.com\labuser. For instance, in my scenario, it is lyanceytest.com\labuser. With Active Directory installed, future configurations can be applied in subsequent labs, and the client VM will seamlessly join the created domain.
